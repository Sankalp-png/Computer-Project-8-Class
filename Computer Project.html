<p align=justify>There is no end to studying the infinite frontier that is space. The exploration of what goes on beyond our planet is the most incredible and epic journey humankind has ever undertaken. The exploration of space is directly related to Eart's past, present and future in relation to the <i><u><font color=darkblue face="Comic Sans MS">Universe</font></u></i>. Information about space allows us to know how we came to exist. what is our place in this universe and many such fascinating aspects about the reality of the millions and millions of explored and unexplored aspects that are part of the Universe.</p><br>

<dt align=center><font size=5 face="Castellar"><b>Galaxies üåå</b></font> <br><br>
<dd>Galaxies are vast space systems of stars, dust, gas, dark matter and star clusters. The word <i><b><font face="Ink Free" color=red>'galaxy'</font></b></i> comes from the Greek word <i><font color=darkorange>galaxies</font></i> which means milky. It refers to our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The word was used because are galaxy appears as a foggy or milky band of light.<br><br>
Galaxies are divided according to their shapes.
<ul>
<li>Regular
<ol type=i>
<li>Elliptical
<li>Spiral
<li>Barrel Spiral
</ol>
<li>Irregular

<dt align=center><font size=5 face="Castellar"><b>Stars üåü‚≠ê</b></font> <br><br>
<dd>Stars are glowing, spherical objects, full of matter called <b><font face="Papyrus" color=babypink>plasma</font></b>. Plasma is the 4<sup>th</sup> state of matter after <font face="Yu Mincho" color=sapgreen><i>solid, liquid, and gas</i></font>. All stars are made of two gases- <font face="MV Boli" color=blue>hydrogen(H<sub>2</sub>)</font> and <font face="Segoe Script" color=burntsienna>helium(He)</font>. The hydrogen accounts for <b><sub>7</sub><font size=2>5%</font></b>, while the helium makes up <b><sub>2</sub><font size=2>5%</font></b> of the matter of a star. As a star ages, hydrogen slowly converts to helium. Thus an old star will have <font size=5>greater</font> amounts of helium.<br><br>

<dd>The closest star to the solar system, <font face="Poor Richard" size=4 color=#650070><b>Proxima Centauri</b></font>, is 4.2 light years away. It means that it will take you 4.2 years to reach Proxima Centauri even if you travelled at the speed of light ‚ö°! <br><br>
<dd><font face="Berlin Sans FB" size=4 color=#650070>Sirius</font> is the brightest star in the night sky! It can be easily located by drawing a straight line to the left of the constellation <font color=red><u>Orion's belt</u></font>. Interestingly, <font face="Arial Narrow"><b>JK Rowling</b></font>, the author of the <font face="Kristen ITC" color=purple>Harry Potter series</font> has named the Godfather of the protagonist of the story Harry Potter after this star- <i>Sirius Black</i>. <br><br>

<dt align=center><font size=5 face="Castellar"><b>Constellations </b></font> <br><br>
<dd>Stars are rarely ever lonely like the Sun. Stars are formed in dense molecular clouds (called <font face="Lucida Handwriting" color=darkpink>"Nebulas"</font>). Ans this results in two or more stars being formed close together. This is why we often find that many stars appear together i a pattern. They are called <font face="Chiller" size=5 color=amber><b>constellations</b></font>. There are <b>88</b> modern constellations. These include 48 classical constellations by the greeks as well as <b><i>12</i></b> as <font face="Comic Sans MS" color=darkblue>Zodiac <sub><b>signs</b></sub></font>. Some of the constellations are-
<ul type=square>
<li>Hydra
<li>Andromeda
<li>Ursa Major (also known as the Big dipper, Big Bear and the <font color=red face="Arial">Saptarshi</font> in India)
<li>Ursa Minor
<li>Cygnus
<li>Canis Major...etc.

<li>The 12 Zodiac Signs are-
<ol type=1>
<li>Aries: the Ram ‚ôà
<li>Taurus: the Bull ‚ôâ
<li>Gemini: the Twins ‚ôä
<li>Cancer: the Crab ‚ôã

<h1 align=center><font face="Castellar">Our Solar System</font></h1>
<dl>
<dt><font size=5 face="Castellar"><b>Sun</b></font>
<dd> Around <font face="papyrus" color=red><b>5000 million years</b></font> back the Sun was formed from a cloud of gas and dust. It consistes of mainly <font face="MV Boli" color=purple>hydrogen (7<sup>4%</sup>)</font> and <font face="Segoe Script" color=burntsienna>helium (2<sup>4%</sup>)</font>.<br><br>
<dt align=center><font face="Kristen ITC" color=red size=4>Fun Facts about our SUN!</font>
<dd><ul>
<li>The sun contains <b>99.86</b> per cent of the total mass of the entire Solar System!!!!!
<li>When millions of years from now the sun would have completed the <font face="Berlin Sans FB" color=red>Red Giant phase</font> it will become a white drawf, which would be the same size as of the earth!!!!!<br><br>
</ul>
<dt><b>The sun has 8 planets revolving around it. They are-</b>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><dt>Mercury
<dd>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is the smallest planet in the Solar system, with a diameter of only 4879 km. It is maned after the greek god who was the Messenger from the heavens, Mercury. Mercury has very long days, as it spins very slowly on its axis, as compared to earth. Mercury has the most number of craters among all the planets in the Solar System. It is very difficult to visit Mercury beacuse of its proximity to the Sun. Up till now only two space crafts have gone to Mercury, the Mariner 10 in 1974-75 and the Messenger probe in 2011-13. It doesn't have any MOONS!!!</ul>
<ul>
<li><dt>Venus
<dd>Venus is the second planet from the sun and the hotest of all the planets. Venus is named after the Roman godess of love and beauty. It is known as the earth's sister planets because of their similar size and mass. Venus rotates in a direction opposite to most other planets (from east to west). This means that the sun rises in the west and sets in the east! Venus is known as the morning and the evening star. Till now, 38 space spacecrafts have been sent to Venus. The first mission was sent by the Russians in 1961, the Venera 1. It was followed by the US probe, Mariner 1. However, Mariner 2 was more successful. </ul>
<ul><li><dt>Earth
<dd>The Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun and is the largest of the terrestial planets. It was formed around 4.54 billion years ago. It is very much unique, and so much coincidences happened, we are still in a doubt that how all the features which can support life happened so intricately. The presence of water and other conditions which suppory life have transformed Earth from a molten planet to its present form. There's nothing much to say about this wonder. It has one natural sattelite, the Moon, which is the fifth largest sattelite in the solar system after the Galilean moons.
<ul type=circle><li><dt>The Moon <br><br>

<dd>The Moon is a spherical body made up of hard rocks and is covered with dust. It is the only natural satellite of Earth. It was formed some 30-50 million years after the formation of our solar system. The size of the moon is one-quarter the size of the Earth.</ul></ul>
<ul><li><dt>Mars
<dd>Mars is the second smallest planet in our solar system and is fourth planet from the Sun. The name is derived from the Roman god of war. It experiencesthe largest dust storms of all the planets in our solar system. Mars is home to the tallest mountain in our solar system, Olympus Mons. Mars was first discovered by Egyptian astronomers in the 2<sup>nd</sup> millenium BCE. Though 40 mission have been planned to Mars, only 18 missions have been successful. For instance our country, India, we should be proud to say that was the first nation in the world to be successful in putting a sattelite in the Martian orbit, by ISRO in September 2014 (MOM Mangalyan mission). It has two moons- Phobos and Deimos. </ul>
<ul><li><dt>Jupiter
<dd>Jupiter is the 5<sup>th</sup> planet from the Sun and is the 4<sup>th</sup> brightest object in our Solar System. It is the largest planet, it spins very fast on its axis, hence it experiences the shortest day in our Solar System. Jupiter is made up of rock, metal and hydrogen compounds. Jupiter, just like Venus, is visible to the naked eye from Earth. Jupiter has more than 50 moons. These are called Jovian moons. Jupiter's largest moon discovered by Galileo, Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, which is even larger than Mercury! As many as eight space crafts have visited this planet. These are: Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, Ulysses and, New Horizons. The most recent was the Juno spacecraft.</ul>
<ul><dt><li>Saturn
<dd>Saturn is the second largest planet, and the sixth planet from the Sun. It is most well-known for its amazing ring system which was first noticed by astronomer Galileo Galilei. Saturn is composed of mixture of gases, like hydrogen and helium. It has a density even lower than water. This means that it will float on water! Saturn is the 5<sup>th</sup> object in the solar system which can be seen clearly using just a small telescope. Its present name comes from the Roman gad, Saturnus, who is the father of Jupiter the king of Gods. Saturn is the flattest planet of the solar system. Saturn is best known for its extensive ring system. Only 4 spacecrafts have gone to Saturn. The most recent one was the Cassini-Huygens mission. It has around 67 moons, of which Titan, the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest moon in the Solar System, is the most famous.</ul>
<ul><dt><li>Uranus
<dd>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and is double the distance from the Sun as compared to Saturn. It was the first planet to be discovered with the help of a telescope as it is not visible to the naked eye. Sir William Herschel was the person who discovered Uranus in 1781. Uranus has a mass equal to 15 earths. Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System.</ul>
<ul><dt><li>Neptune
<dd> Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. </ul>
